    </div>

    <p><span id="first_letter" class="first_letter">F</span>red is simply keen on words. He especially is intrigued how they shape and serve people in their lives.</p> 
	<p>His words have been serving people and shaping their lives since the mid-1960s when he began writing articles for The Times, the weekly newspaper his family published in Walworth, Wisconsin. For the last 40 years words have been the vehicle for exposing him to a wide variety of experiences, events, topics, and contacts with people.</p>
	<p>Fred has edited weekly newspapers, a regional magazine, a drag racing paper, and a real estate promotional publication. His articles have been published in local, regional, and national publications. </p>
	<p>Image Source has been owned and operated by Fred since 1995. In addition to continuing journalism, he has written such materials as brochures, resumes, letters, advertisements, and Web site content. He also does photography, primarily black-and-white landscape art images.</p>
	<p>He pays close attention to detail. Promptness and dependability enhance his services, as do flexibility and focus. Relating well with many types of people, he adapts quickly to working one on one or in a group. He is skilled at copyediting, proofreading, advertising, photo editing, publication evaluation, and idea development. </p>
	<p>More details about Fred's career follow:</p>
	
	<b><h3>Achievements</h3></b>
	<p><b>Image Source:</b> Clients for writing, editing, photography, and consulting have included companies, organizations, and individuals. He has met the goals for each client's project. On a regular basis he contributes articles to Wiring Harness News and does copyediting for the quarterly publications of Geneva Lake Conservancy in Fontana, Wisconsin, and Geneva Lake Environmental Agency in Williams Bay, Wisconsin. He also serves as publicist for the Historical Society of Walworth and Big Foot Prairie.</p>
	<p><b>Shopper Sunday (now called Walworth County Sunday):</b> This 35,000 circulation general-interest weekly publication covers people, events, and activities in Walworth County, Wisconsin.  In helping to launch the publication, Fred designed many aspects of it, including the nameplate. As the sole full-time person on the editorial staff, he conceptualized each edition; edited, wrote, rewrote, and proofread 30-50 articles per week; did most of the photography; laid out the front page; and made assignments to freelance photographers. The publication quickly became popular with county residents, and several sent testimonials about the high quality of his work.  </p>
	<p><b>Genoa City Progress, Lake & Country, Lake Geneva Magazine:</b> These are three Walworth County publications he also helped to start. After contributing significantly to designing them, he did extensive editing, writing, and photography to make a strong impact on the readers of the publications.</p>
	<p><b>United Racer, The Times:</b> Since these were existing publications (covering the United States and a portion of Walworth County, respectively), he was required to determine and arrange for content, which was produced by staff members, freelancers, and himself. At United Racer he did writing, photography, and copyediting as well as typesetting and layout. Those same jobs were done at The Times, which he owned and served as publisher and general manager. He instituted major changes to upgrade the quality of the paper, including more news coverage, better photography, complete layout and design remake, and local focus of editorials.  </p>

His goal with articles written and edited by him is always clear reader understanding, which he achieves through thorough preparation and attention to detail. He has developed a reputation as being fair-minded, accurate, and dedicated.</p>
	<br>
	
	<b><h3>Photography and Photo Editing</h3></b>
	<p>During the past 30-plus years he has continued to be fascinated by what can be photographed and how images affect him as well as the people viewing them. His years as an editor have included extensive work as a photojournalist and a photo editor with a keen eye for composition and storytelling. Also, he has done black-and-white art photography that has been displayed in shows and museums and has been purchased by interested persons.</p>
