Headline: Welcome to Woodstar Products<br>
History text:</p>
	<p>Woodstar Products has focused on manufacturing durable and economical horse stalls since 1977, the year Woodstar was founded by my father, Brent Starck. He saw the need for not only sturdy, well-built stalls but ones with terrific looks. His innovative concept was highly acclaimed back then, and it has endured to this day. 
	</p>
	<p>Over the years Woodstar has firmly established itself as a nationally recognized manufacturer of high-quality horse stalls and barn accessories. Developed, designed, and built to exacting standards, our many fine products are used at thousands of equine facilities across the United States.
	</p>
	<p>All Woodstar products enjoy their excellent reputation because they are built with the finest materials by uncompromising craftsmen. Equally important is our commitment to providing the best service to our customers by addressing their every need with personalized attention. 
	</p>
	<p>We look forward to working with you!

    <p>All Woodstar doors are shipped completely assembled, sanded, and ready to hang. Choose from the traditional R-48 style to the more contemporary V-48/H-48 or D-48 style as shown here. Each door's inside edges are clad with galvanized edging ("bite guard") to prevent cribbing. Vertical door edges are wrapped with galvanized steel channel for added protection and beauty. Every door is stretch-wrapped and shipped directly to your specified site.<br>
    <p>Each Woodstar front grill panel (FG) or side grill panel (SG) is custom-built and completely assembled to your specified length - up to 12 feet long. Steel grill bars 7/8'' in diameter are set 3 1/8'' apart for strength and safety. The grill bars are protected with Gatorshield. It is a triple-flow zinc coating process that is 30% more effective than hot-dipped galvanized steel in preventing rust and corrosion. A powder-coat finish in black or green is also available.</p>

    <p>You tell us what kind of barn door you would like, and we will build it. The Woodstar custom barn door is just that - custom! It is built according to the size and materials you want. Your door will be shipped directly to your site - complete and ready to hang!<br>
    <p>The structural frame of your door consists of two extruded aluminum vertical rails. If a split sliding door is required, one of the vertical rails has a built-in H closure to assure a well-sealed, tight fit. The rails are designed to accept southern yellow pine 2x6-inch door girts. These are placed carefully to coincide with your design, whether it calls for a solid or glass door. <br>
    <p>If glass is preferred, you may choose an insulated panel, with an enclosed window grid, or a single-pane glass that has been individually glazed. The sliding hardware system consists of a track, trolleys, stay rollers, Sta-Tite latches, door pulls, door stops, and cane bolts (where applicable). <br>
    <p>Our well-trained staff will assist you with your door design in every way.</p>

    <p>Swing-Out Waterer (SOW) - Safe and easy to use, this five-gallon insulated bucket holder swings freely in a heavy-gauge galvanized steel frame that is also adaptable to our utility bucket holder (BH).<br>
    <p>Feed Door (FD) - This door can be built into the front grill panel at your desired location.  The 28x28'' opening is large enough to feed both hay and grain while allowing your horse the freedom to put his or her head out.<br>
    <p>Wall Feeder (WF) - This molded poly unit is designed for durability and safety.  A 6'' deep grain dish is positioned below a 1/4-bale hay rack.<br>

    <p>Track and Trolleys: The oval-shaped track is made of galvanized 12-gauge steel, and the Zelcon trolleys have needle bearings to assure effortless ease while opening and closing the sliding door.<br>
    <p>Stay Roller: It has an adjustable Zelcon guide roller set in a heavy-duty 1/4'' galvanized steel bracket mounted directly to the post cap. Positive door placement is assured at all times.<br>
    <p>Spring-Loaded Safety Latch: When opening the door, the safety latch automatically retracts to a safe position. There is no chance of creating a hazard by having the latch protrude into the doorway.<br>
    <p>Post Anchor: No holes to dig, no concrete to pour. Front posts are set easily and accurately. If your ground is soil (not concrete or blacktop), drive post anchor into ground so the welded stud is above grade. Drill hole in the bottom of the post and set over anchor stud. Two anchors are needed per stall. Each anchor measures 15 inches.<br>

<a name="Concept"></a><b>Brochure Text of Concept Mold & Die, Burlington, Wisconsin</b> </p>

    <p>At Concept Mold & Die we are fully dedicated to your total satisfaction with our mold workmanship and with our service to your firm. We aim to meet -- and even exceed -- your expectations of what we can provide to your company: You will have what you need when you need it. <br>
    <p>Whether a single-cavity prototype mold or a multicavity production mold, it will be completed and delivered according to your production schedule. We are keenly aware of how shorter lead times for shipping end products have tightened every aspect of mold development and piece manufacturing, so you can rely on our flexibility to meet your deadlines. <br>
    <p>With our commitment to precision machining by talented technicians using state-of-the-art equipment, you will find Concept molds produce flawless parts by the tens, hundreds, or thousands. You can count on our molds for superb repeatability that pleases your valued customers, prevent costly downtime and rework, and boosts your bottom line. <br>
    <p>Expert analysis of your mold requirements is provided by owner James Berna. He has been involved in making molds 20 years, and his knowledge can lead to long-term benefits for your company. Since Concept's founding in 1992 many long-lasting relationships have been forged with companies such as yours. The wealth of experience of Concept's well-trained staff members enables them to understand the intricacies of every mold. Such expertise is applied to designs that are produced by us or those supplied by your firm. Regardless, we always keep lines of communication open so designs can be improved for lower mold cost, greater production efficiency, and higher product quality.<br>
    <p>A plastic part is only as good as its mold. To assure development of the best mold design, we are willing to meet with your staff at our facility, at your company, or at the design firm. We have built Concept Mold & Die on cooperation and flexibility, so we are determined to meet your every need in the design phase. <br>
    <p>Designs are produced on three CAD stations using the latest technologies in designing, modeling, or surfacing. Once each design has been finalized, the mold is produced by holding each operation to the tightest tolerances. Such craftsmanship is made possible by the use of the latest technology in every aspect of the mold-building procedure. Skillful operation of the equipment is done by people who have received extensive training in mold making on the job and in the classroom. A premium is placed on the staff receiving more education in CNC, theory, and general math to improve the molds you use for prototype or production. Besides employees receiving additional training, they constantly are informed about the latest trends in the industry and kept up to date about every customer's needs. Such communication and education have led to a talented, conscientious, and diversified group of employees always willing to assist each other. This cooperative attitude has meant greater staff satisfaction and continual company growth.<br>
    <p>Once the mold has been completed, we have a full array of rapid delivery options available to you. We can ship by our truck in southern Wisconsin and northern Illinois, arrange for overnight delivery, and send other shipments via commercial truck or air as required. <br>
    <p>Molds also may be sent to us for repair or rework and quick turnaround. Our facility is located just off an Interstate highway, so deliveries from your company can be made with ease and convenience. As needed, your company will benefit by having one of our staff visit your firm to repair or rework a mold, review a design, or evaluate a production process. <br>
    <p>To see how Concept Mold & Die can serve your company as a partner for progress and growth, contact us by phone, fax, or e-mail at concept@pensys.com.</p>

History</p>

    <p>Many a company has been started by one person in a basement or a garage. Such is the way Concept Mold & Die began in February 1992. <br>
    <p>Due to a high demand for Concept's high-quality molds, just two years later the firm was relocated from the garage to a 3,000 square-foot facility in Burlington, Wisconsin. The larger facility enabled the firm to add equipment to meet growing customer needs.<br>
    <p>Today Concept Mold & Die makes molds for companies that manufacture parts for the electronics, automobile, medical, and consumer product industries. Concept's customer base ranges from local to international, and Concept molds are used by companies in Wisconsin, Illinois, and other states whose products are distributed nationwide and worldwide.</p>

Home Page</p>

    <p>Foremost Media has developed hundreds of successful Web sites for a wide variety of businesses - from small, start-up companies to large corporations. Thousands of companies are capable of building you a Web site, but if you are serious about on-line success for your business, you deserve a site by Foremost Media. Take advantage of our vast experience, leading-edge expertise, and excellent service.</p>

Web Site Development Page</p>

    <p>A Web site is more than what simply appears on a computer screen. Much more! Developing and supporting your on-line presence involves many variables, of which your Web site is only one. Just having a site does not ensure on-line success for your company. Emphasis also must be placed on having the site found, reviewing the site's Web presence, analyzing on-line business effectiveness, and updating functionality as needed. They are among the services Foremost Media can provide you. <br>
    <p>Because of tremendous advancements in Internet technologies, the Web offers virtually unlimited growth potential for companies of all sizes. Businesses are using the Web to communicate more effectively with their customers, share secure documents and files with vendors, train employees, and, of course, sell products and services. Many traditional business functions can be managed more easily and less costly on-line. With lower operating costs comes increased profitability. <br>
    <p>One important advantage of your company's on-line presence is measurable results, which are derived from your business objectives. They are developed with specific purposes in mind and can be measured based on your business plan. Also, your on-line presence is scalable, meaning it can be expanded as your business grows.<br>
    <p>You will see how valuable an on-line presence really is as you attract and communicate with more customers, expand into more markets, take more orders, reduce training expenses, and spend less time exchanging documents through the mail or with couriers. And these are only a few of ways we at Foremost Media can help your company take advantage of the Web.<br>
    <p>Should you be considering Web site package deals, we urge you to be very careful. For instance, an on-line search for "Web designer" or "Web development" will return literally millions of pages of businesses, both big and small, offering Web site packages for your business. You could pay one flat amount for a three-page site or a higher price for 10 pages and a free e-mail account. The prices vary, but the approach is the same: You decide how many pages you want, and you are given a site to match. Or, you may have to build it yourself. This simple approach sounds appealing. It works well when buying a pizza but not for shopping for an important business service.<br>
    <p>Years ago, often a business Web site was little more than an on-line brochure. That is what you have by buying a Web site by the page. Granted, modern Web browsers today allow for more graphically rich layouts, but you still have an on-line brochure. It may succeed at giving prospects information about your company (assuming they can even find your site), but the technique will not do much for your bottom line.<br> 
    <p>So, if your site is costing you money instead of making you money, you need to make a change. To learn more about a developing, maintaining, and expanding an on-line presence that really works for your business, contact Foremost Media today at 608-758-4841.</p>

Web Site Hosting Page</p>

    <p>What you don't know about Web hosting can hurt your business. <br>
    <p>Web site hosting is one of the most competitive markets on the Internet. Everyone from Internet service providers to individuals with a couple of spare servers offer hosting. A little-known fact about the Web-hosting industry is that many hosting "companies" are merely individuals reselling another company's hosting services. These middle people operate strictly on volume and have no control over the services they offer. <br>
    <p>When faced with so many options, you may be tempted to make a decision based solely on price, but the consequences of choosing the wrong host for your site can be costly. You would not think of opening a store without first researching the location; the same care must be applied when selecting a host for your business Web site. <br>
    <p>You will benefit from the business-grade Web hosting at Foremost Media. We offer a variety of affordable, feature-packed hosting plans with built-in security and reliability. By choosing us to host your Web site, you receive:<br>
