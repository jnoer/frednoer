		<p><b>Presentation</b>
		</p>
		
		<p>All photographs are crafted by Fred in his darkroom. Each image is produced on fiber silver gelatin paper. Fiber is an art paper of the highest quality, producing a rich-looking image. 
		</p>
		<p>The available sizes of photographs are 4x5, 5x7, 8x10, 11x14, and 16x20 inches. Each photograph has approximately a quarter-inch border. Cropping of a photograph as displayed on this site may be required according to the proportions of the requested size. 
		</p>
		<p>Only fiber photos are available matted or framed. The white window mat covers approximately an eighth-inch on each side of the photo. Matted sizes (vertical and horizontal) are: 8x10 (for a 4x5 photograph), 11x14 (for a 5x7), 14x18 (for an 8x10), 16x20 (for an 11x14), and 22x28 (for a 16x20). The horizontal framed sizes are: 9x9&frac12; (for a 4x5 photograph), 11x12&frac12; (for a 5x7), 14x15&frac12; (for an 8x10), 18x20&frac12; (for an 11x14), and 24x27&frac12; (for a 16x20). The vertical framed sizes are: 8&frac12;x10 (for a 4x5 photograph), 10&frac12;x13 (for a 5x7), 13&frac12;x16 (for an 8x10), 17&frac12;x21 (for an 11x14), and 23&frac12;x28 (for a 16x20).
		</p>
		<p>All mounting and backing materials are archival quality, meaning they are free of acids that deteriorate a photograph. The materials will last as long as the photograph (75 years or longer), and the brightness and tone of the mat board will not diminish. Each flat-black anodized aluminum frame is of museum-grade quality. The finished framed photograph appears similar to the way the photos are displayed on the Web site.
		</p>
		<p>Every photograph is signed and comes with an artist's statement and a label containing the title, scene location, date when the scene was photographed, and signature. The label may be affixed to the back of the framed work if you so desire.
