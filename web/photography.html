    <H2>Enjoy Beautiful Black-and-White Photographs<br>

    <p><span id="first_letter" class="first_letter">T</span>wo words &#8211; endless wonder &#8211; pointedly describe Fred's interest in photography. He never ceases to be fascinated by what can be photographed and how images affect him as well as people who view his work.</p>
    <p>Recording his observations of the world through photography began in 1973. His first photos were of car races in Milwaukee and Indianapolis, enabling him to add a new dimension to his deep interest in motorsports, especially drag racing. He also started practicing photojournalism of area community events and wrote articles for The Times, the weekly newspaper in Walworth his parents bought in 1957. He owned, edited, and published the paper in 1980-86.</p>
    <p>The editorial page of the newspaper, which was printed in black and white, always displayed a scenic photograph. Having to shoot for that page provided the impetus for Fred to photograph landscapes of Geneva Lake and the surrounding countryside on a regular basis. Walking the lake path or driving a country road always enabled him to slow the hectic pace of his life. That calming effect never has waned, and it serves as a motivation for doing scenic photography. If he seeks to have his photos convey a message, it is to urge all of us to stop and look more keenly at what is closest to us, especially in our communities. We will be amazed at what we see.</p>
    <p>His work appeared in Lake Geneva Magazine and Shopper Sunday, which he also edited.  Since 1995 he has done freelance writing, editing, and photography and contributed to a variety of local, regional, and national publications.</p>
    <p>His landscapes also have been exhibited in shows in Wisconsin communities at Community Bank, Aram Public Library, and Taste of Europe in Delavan; Community Bank and Walworth County Courthouse in Elkhorn; Charles A. Wustum Museum of Fine Arts in Racine; Hoard Historical Museum in Fort Atkinson; George Williams Gallery in Williams Bay; and Seippel Center for the Arts in Beaver Dam.</p>
    <p>Fred's work may be viewed at J'Marc Graphics at 235 Broad Street in downtown Lake Geneva, Wisconsin. </p>
    <p>As you will discover by exploring the <a ng-href="#/galleries">galleries</a>, most of Fred's photography is done around Geneva Lake in Walworth County, Wisconsin, and in other communities and the countryside in the county. He also has made images outside the county, which you will find in the Miscellaneous gallery. </p>
    <p>In addition to his art, Fred's years as an editor included extensive work as a photojournalist and a photo editor with a keen eye for composition and storytelling. If you need assistance evaluating and editing your photographs, he can provide it.</p>
