                                        With so much attention focused on the rampaging late-model Cobra Jet Mustangs, NHRA Super Stock competitors might be tempted to dismiss earlier models of the original pony car. Racers would do so at their peril, particularly if in the other lane is a certain 1964&frac12; Mustang.

                                        Perhaps more than any other season, the distinctive blue-and-silver Ford owned by Everett Hill, 66, and driven by his son James Hill, 29, both of Fayetteville, Ga., is primed for an outstanding 2012. The year would be one of the best in Everett's ownership that dates back to 1974.

                                        That year George "Red" Givens, Everett's long-time friend and current crew chief, was phoned by a friend who owned a junkyard. He told Givens about a Mustang with a blown engine that had been driven by a little old lady from South Carolina.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Hill bought the car, and he and Givens transformed it into a stick-shift racecar and first hit the track in 1976, ready to take on all competitors, many of them with automatics. The car continued Hill's racing career that began in the early 1960s with a '53 Chevy coupe. At one point he was intent on ordering a 1967 Chevy Super Sport Nova hardtop with a 327, but he was dissuaded by the delivery time.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Instead, Hill acquired a 1964 Falcon, which he raced, and then a 1967 Mustang. Primarily street driven, it was stolen and never returned. With the insurance money he ordered a '69 Mustang with the Super Cobra Jet package. The car was rare, one of seven, because it was not the more common Mach I. Busy with too many hobbies, he sold the car for $3,000, but the young buyer totaled it. What would it be worth today?

                            Hill's current Mustang may not be as unique but has high historical value. He has raced the car more than 30 years, has scored 70-plus class wins and has set numerous national records. Hill has made thousands of passes, since years ago he raced up to five times a week at Southeastern tracks. He was fourth in Division 2 in 1991, ran the first 10.20s in SS/K in 2001 and the next year was the first in the 10.30s in SS/L.

                        <p>
                            Hill long had been racing when James was born in 1982, and he has accompanied his father every year since then. At 10 he started working on the car, cleaning valve covers and sparkplugs.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            At 11 years old Hill also began racing radio-controlled (RC) cars and pursued the sport until he was 20. His cars, which went up to 70-90 m.p.h., competed on tracks up to 600 feet long and an occasional velodrome throughout the South and on the East Coast. He won Georgia and Alabama state championships in 1996.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Two years later, Hill, 16, joined RC-racing friends at a weeklong race camp at Atlanta Motor Speedway. He raced Legends and Bandolero cars on a road course and oval track. "It was fun," he said. "If someone would come along with an offer to race one of those cars, I would jump at it."
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            That same year Everett urged James to make a pass in the Mustang. Having never driven a stick-shift car, his initiation lasted just one run. "The car had way more power and was a whole lot more radical than anything I had driven," Hill said. "I wasn't necessarily afraid of it, but it definitely got my attention. I decided it was not something I wanted to do right now."
                        </p>

                    <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-6">
                        <p>
                            Over the next several years Hill continued RC racing and then concentrated on earning a degree in finance from Auburn (Ala.) University in 2007. He occasionally raced his Fox-body supercharged and turbocharged stick-shift Mustangs. Also, Everett bought an O/SA 1964 Comet station wagon for James to become accustomed to class racing. The 3,200-pound car has a 289-inch engine putting out 300 h.p. and has run a best of 12.30 at 107.                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After competing with the Comet several times, James returned to the Mustang under unusual circumstances. Everett fell 19 feet from a deer stand in late 2008, injuring his shoulder, knee and ankle. He required surgery during his three-day hospital stay, but upon his release the next day he roofed an outbuilding.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            "You're not going to keep that man down!" James said, noting his father recovered fully. But, initially he could not drive the Mustang, so James began racing it in early 2009 at age 26. He was much more prepared than 10 years earlier.                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The car was different, too. It underwent a rotisserie restoration in 2005-07, the most extensive work on the car since a 1997 chassis update and a 1985 revamping. The new paint, which replaced the basic all-white, was designed and applied by Jim McCleallan.                         </p>
                        <p>
                            Engine problems plagued James' Division 2 driving debut, and one of his few highlights the rest of the year was winning a local five-speed heads-up shootout event. He rebounded to finish 10th in the division in 2010, he won the shootout again, and his father set the GT/L records at 10.51 at 124.06 in November 2010 with a new combination                        </p>
