                                        With the odds stacked so heavily against them, you may be tempted to ask stick-shift racers in NHRA Stock and Super Stock why they even bother running a manual transmission. Go ahead and ask, but don't be surprised if you're met with a blank stare, indicating they may not even understand the question, let alone why you're asking.

                                        That is, they never would consider running an automatic, reducing the number of pedals in their cars from three to two. Labeling them 'diehard" is understating their intensity - and their love of a challenge.

                    "People tell me they love it," Huellewig said. "They say, `That's the coolest thing I've ever seen.' That's especially true when they look inside or underneath it. A lot of people have said it looks like a street rod."

                        Without the classic Moon gas tank, lettering, slicks and wheelie bars, Dan Huellewig's Super Gas 1932 Ford Victoria easily could be mistaken for a street rod.
