                                            With so much attention focused on the rampaging late-model Cobra Jet Mustangs, NHRA Super Stock competitors might be tempted to dismiss earlier models of the original pony car. Racers would do so at their peril, particularly if in the other lane is a certain 1964&frac12; Mustang.                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        With the odds stacked so heavily against them, you may be tempted to ask stick-shift racers in NHRA Stock and Super Stock why they even bother running a manual transmission. Go ahead and ask, but don't be surprised if you're met with a blank stare, indicating they may not even understand the question, let alone why you're asking.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        That is, they never would consider running an automatic, reducing the number of pedals in their cars from three to two. Labeling them "diehard" is understating their intensity - and their love of a challenge.
                                    </p>

                                        "A stick is the only way to go," said Jason McCormack, 37, of Columbiaville, Mich. He began NHRA Stock racing in 1998, and since 2002 he has run an A/S 1966 Plymouth Belvedere with a 600-h.p. Hemi, a Jerico four-speed and a dual-disc seven-inch clutch from Advanced Clutches. The 3,570-pound car has turned a best . . .

                                    How well Jeff Colvert knows. The 57-year-old resident of Arkadelphia, Ark., has been involved in the sport 40 years, and he always has raced stick cars except for half a season when he tried an automatic transmission. He often sets national records, wins class and goes rounds.

The car runs primarily in SS/F and set the national record in October at 9.29 at 143.63. The 3,230-pound Ford has a 428-inch Cobra Jet engine with a factory rating of 335 h.p., an NHRA factor of 354 h.p. and a dyno number of 780 h.p. . . . .
