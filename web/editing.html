		F</span>or readers of your publications to be well informed, the right information must be presented in appealing ways. With 40 years in journalism, 13 of them as an editor, Fred knows how to pull together all elements of a publication so it serves its readers well.

He relishes each opportunity to use his imagination to conceptualize ideas and implement them with his skills. They include reporting, interviewing, writing, rewriting, copyediting, proofreading, headline writing, photography, photo editing, cutline writing, and publication and page design.

	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Shopper Sunday (now called Walworth County Sunday):</b> This 35,000 circulation general-interest weekly publication covers people, events, and activities in Walworth County, Wisconsin.  In helping to launch the publication, Fred designed many aspects of it, including the nameplate.  As the sole full-time person on the editorial staff, he conceptualized each edition; wrote, rewrote, copyedited, and proofread 30-50 articles per week; did most of the photography; laid out the front page; and made assignments to freelance photographers. The publication quickly became popular with county residents, and several sent testimonials about the high quality of his work.

	<p>
		<b>Genoa City Progress, Lake & Country, Lake Geneva Magazine:</b> These are three Walworth County publications Fred also helped to start. After contributing significantly to designing them, he did extensive editing, writing, and photography to make a strong impact on the readers of the publications.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>United Racer, The Times:</b> Since these were existing publications (covering the United States and a portion of Walworth County, respectively), Fred was required to determine and arrange for content, which was produced by staff members, freelancers, and himself. At United Racer he did writing, photography, and copyediting as well as typesetting and layout. Those same jobs were done at The Times, which he owned and served as publisher and general manager. He instituted major changes to upgrade the quality of the paper, including more news coverage, better photography, complete layout and design remake, and local focus of editorials.
