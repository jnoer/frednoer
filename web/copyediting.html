        <p><span id="first_letter" class="first_letter">R</span>eader understanding and enjoyment are enhanced when text flows smoothly. Clear and concise written communications make a strong impact, providing maximum benefit to readers and you, your company, or your organization. </p>
        <p>Copyediting by Fred dissolves the constant worry about possible text shortcomings and having to apologize for them. Such mistakes as misspelled words and poor grammar are not only embarrassing but costly, since time and money are wasted on redoing materials. Therefore, Fred understands and stresses that copyediting is one of the most important services he provides.</p>
        <p>When you need high-quality text, draw upon Fred's expertise and 30 years of copyediting. He also has done writing 40 years. In his copyediting and writing he has been exposed to a wide assortment of topics, issues, events, and people pertaining to such aspects of life as government, business, sports, economics, crime, agriculture, art, celebration, and education. They provide a store of knowledge on which to draw when he copyedits. </p>
        <p>He did copyediting while serving 13 years as the editor of a weekly newspaper and a weekly general-interest publication. Copyediting also was one of his duties when he edited a lifestyle magazine, a real estate firm's promotional publication, a monthly drag racing newspaper, and a community publication advocating construction of a racetrack. He donates copyediting to Geneva Lake Conservancy in Fontana, Wisconsin, and Geneva Lake Environmental Agency in Williams Bay, Wisconsin, for their quarterly newsletters.</p>
        <p>With the proliferation of Web sites, Fred has taken a special interest in copyediting them. Often their text is prepared by people uncomfortable with writing and unfamiliar with the finer points of grammar, punctuation, capitalization, and phrasing. A site can have the slickest design and fastest download time, but if the text is not understood easily, quickly, and completely, the effectiveness of the layout and speed is diminished greatly. </p>
        <p>The value of Fred's copyediting especially is heightened when he works with clients on an ongoing basis. The amount of his time (and therefore his cost) decreases as writers become more familiar with what they could do to write better based on his revisions. He also develops style sheets specifically for publications and projects that show acceptable forms of punctuation, </p>
        <p>capitalization, abbreviation, etc. The sheets reflect and augment the Associated Press stylebook widely used in mainstream media. Use of specific style sheets and the AP book reduces copyediting time and expense because a writer uses the proper elements the first time.</p>

        <p>
            Because of his years as an editor, as Fred copyedits he can analyze the content for writer intent and reader comprehension and provide insightful feedback. </p>

        <p>To assure your text is high quality, Fred looks for such details as:<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Faulty spelling, grammar, and punctuation<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Consistency in spelling, hyphenation, numerals, fonts, and capitalization<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Incorrect usage<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Specific references<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Sequencing (such as alphabetical order) in lists and other material.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Smooth transitions<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Missing text<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Parallel structure in text and headings<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Consistent handling of key terms<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Ambiguous or incorrect statements<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Wordiness, triteness, and inappropriate jargon<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Relocation of sentences<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Additions and deletions</p>
