		<p><span id="first_letter" class="first_letter">A</span>lthough a simple process, proofreading is vital to the quality of your text. Correcting mistakes before it is published assures you the reader will not be distracted from what you are saying. 
		</p>
			Due to Fred's experience in editing and publishing and his technical knowledge of English, he quickly and accurately spots and corrects misspellings, punctuation errors, and format inconsistencies. He is able to compare proofs to original or copyedited materials or only review the proofs. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Also, since he is a skilled copy editor, Fred can advise if copyediting is needed prior to proofreading. He has done copyediting 30 years and writing 40 years. In that time he has been exposed to many topics, issues, events, and people pertaining to such aspects of life as government, business, sports, economics, crime, agriculture, art, celebration, and education. They provide a store of knowledge on which to draw when he does proofreading and copyediting.
