    <H2>With the Right Words,<br/>Watch Your Ideas Grow</H2>


    <p><span id="first_letter" class="first_letter">Y</span>our ideas will blossom with clear, concise writing and editing by Fred Noer that meet the exact needs of your business or organization or you as an individual. <p>
    When your business or organization requires text for Web sites, news releases, brochures, or advertisements, it is written to gain the maximum exposure and impact for your products and/or services and to present and maintain your best image. <p>
    Since your business or organization faces intense competition for people's time and attention, the importance of well-written communications never has been stronger. They not only convey important information but help to meet people's expectations for high quality in every aspect of your company or group. Excellent communications form an essential part of a solid foundation for your business to prosper in the marketplace or your organization to contribute to its community.  <p>
    Communications such as Web sites, brochures, and news releases often are prepared by people uncomfortable with writing and unfamiliar with the finer points of grammar, punctuation, capitalization, and syntax. For example, your Web site can have the slickest design and fastest download time, but if the text is not understood easily, quickly, and completely, the site fails to provide maximum benefit for the viewers and you. <p>
    As an individual, you may be interested in composing letters, memoirs, family histories, biographies, stories, and autobiographies. You will connect best with your readers through well-written and copyedited text. <p>
